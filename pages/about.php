            <div class="history-card"> Rukara Model School was established as part of the Rwanda Quality Basic Education for Human Capital Development (RQBEHCD) project of MINEDUC, a government initiative funded by the World Bank after the University of Rwanda-College of Education (UR-CE) submitted a list of
the priorities intended to improve the quality of education in schools, and also for the training of pre-service teachers. <br>
 
The list included support to Teachers Training Centres (TTCs), establishment of a
Demonstration school at UR-Rukara Campus (head office of UR-CE), strengthening the teaching of STEM subjects in basic education schools, enhancing English proficiency and digital literacy for TTC and UR-CE students. All these priorities were considered with or without modifications to fit the purpose. The project aimed to improve teacher training and enhance the quality of education in Rwanda by building model schools across the country. The construction of Rukara Model School was completed in 2024, and it officially opened its doors for the 2024-2025 academic year.

<br>Before its establishment, Teacher Training Centers (TTCs) in Rwanda faced several challenges, including limited access to practical teaching environments. Many trainee teachers had to rely on theoretical coursework without sufficient hands-on experience in real classrooms. Rukara Model School was built to address this gap by serving as a demonstration school where student-teachers could gain practical teaching experience under the guidance of professional educators.

<br>The school was designed to reflect modern educational standards, featuring state-of-the-art facilities such as fully equipped science laboratories, a digital resource center, and innovative teaching spaces. Since its opening, the school has played a key role in developing future educators, offering them a space to practice and refine their teaching methods. The integration of ICT in education at Rukara Model School has also set a benchmark for other schools in the region, making it a pioneer in digital learning.

<br>Over time, Rukara Model School is expected to continue growing as a center of excellence in teacher education, contributing to Rwandaâ€™s broader goals of achieving quality education for all.

<br>It offers Programmes in the line of General education where we find Nursery Education, Primary Education, Ordinary level and Advanced level with options of Mathematics-Economics and Geography (MEG), Mathematics-Computer Science and Economics (MCE) and Physics- Chemistry and Mathematics (PCM).
